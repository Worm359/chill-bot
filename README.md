# Chill-Bot

A lightweight Discord music bot written in **Java17** and **Kotlin**. It uses the Java Discord API (JDA) for gateway interaction, **Lavaplayer** for audio streaming, and **yt-dlp** for on-demand media retrieval. Integration with the **YouTube Data API** enables playlist support and track metadata lookup. Command parsing follows the Unix‚Äêstyle convention provided by **Apache-Commons-CLI**.

---

## Key Features

* Works with any Discord server where the bot has voice permissions.
* Supports YouTube playlist import and per-track duration limits.
* Queue navigation commands: `next`/`prev`/`playNext`/`playNow`/`skipTo`/`add`.
* Download-then-play workflow powered by **yt-dlp** to minimise buffering issues.
* Command line style syntax familiar to users of Unix utilities (implemented with **Apache-Commons-CLI**).
* Designed for self-hosting; no external stateful services are required.

   cd chill-bot
   ```
2. **Build**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. Setup settings:
	* Copy `chill-bot/src/main/resources/application.example.properties` to `chill-bot/devrun` folder
	* Edit the settings according to your needs. The most important are:
		- `chill-bot.discord.token`
		- `chill-bot.youtube.api-key`
		- `chill-bot.youtube.maximum-video-length-minutes`
		- `chill-bot.youtube.ytp-dlp-bin`
4. **Run** (slash at the end for --spring.config.location folder is mandatory)

   ```bash
   java -jar chill-bot/devrun/chill-bot.jar --spring.config.location=chill-bot/devrun/
   ```

You can move the application files from `devrun` to wherever you like.
